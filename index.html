        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with a degree in
          Computer Science, delivering innovative and high-quality solutions for
          various clients. My expertise lies in <strong>HTML5</strong>,
          <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>software development</strong>. I
          have a proven track record in client collaboration, code review, and I
          am always eager to take on new and exciting challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am particularly passionate about creating innovative solutions and
          constantly learning new technologies. My recent work has allowed me to
          dive deep into <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Blazor</strong>, and
          <strong>.NET</strong>, which I've used to develop a web app that
          modernizes the paper records system of a collision repair shop by
          inputting and storing customer and vehicle data.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to my work in web development, I've also contributed to
          <strong>robotic mapping research</strong> for the Powder-RENEW project
          with Rice University, which was planned to be featured on a rover.
          Furthermore, I've collaborated on
          <strong>machine learning research</strong> for EEG testing using
          Python, R, and the SVM algorithm, benchmarking results against the KNN
          method.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe in the power of technology to drive progress and am excited
          to work together to achieve greatness!

          <h2>WorkFlow (Freelance)</h2>
          <p>
            Since June 2023, I have been working on a personal project titled
            “Workflow - Desktop App”. This project, which demonstrates my
            technical skills in C#, .NET, Blazor, and Supabase, is aimed at
            updating an automotive body shop from paper record keeping to a
            digital format. The application, engineered using C# and Blazor,
            facilitates user input of customer and vehicle data in a collision
            repair shop environment. By utilizing the Supabase API for database
            management, the application ensures robust and secure storage of
            customer information along with user authentication. This project
            showcases my ability to develop efficient software solutions and
            manage databases effectively using modern APIs, while contributing
            to the digital transformation of traditional business processes.

          <h2>EEG and Machine Learning (Research Assistant)</h2>
          <p>
            From January to May 2023, I served as a Research Assistant, focusing
            on the intersection of Machine Learning and Electroencephalography
            (EEG) testing. My work involved the application of the Support
            Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm using Python and R, demonstrating my
            advanced programming skills and understanding of Machine Learning
            algorithms. A key aspect of the research was comparing our findings
            with previous studies that utilized the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
            algorithm, showcasing my analytical skills and critical thinking.

          <h2>Powder-RENEW (Research Assistant)</h2>
          <p>
            I contributed to a significant robotic mapping research project in
            collaboration with Rice University. This research was specifically
            designed for the Powder-RENEW project, with the intention of being
            featured on the rover. My involvement in this project underscores my
            ability to contribute to cutting-edge research in robotics and space
            exploration
